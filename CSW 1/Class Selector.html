        <h1 class="styling">
            This is a class selector.We have used .styling and p.styling.This is a heading so .styling will be implemented on this.
        </h1>
        <p class="styling">
            This is a class selector.This is a paragraph so p.styling and .styling both will be implemented.Incase,both have same attributes like text-alignand their values are different then align in p.styling will be implemented.This we cannot implement on heading as it is not a paragraph so heading will always take values of .styling only.
